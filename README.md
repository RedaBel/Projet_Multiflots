# Projet_Multiflots
Here, you will find the final code for my second year project in ISIMA.
This project treats the multi-commodity flow problem and network design by using CPLEX and generating the LP files through a C++ program.
You may find the report (in french, sorry) and the code. It's aim is to generate random instances of graphs for optimization purpose and algorithms comparison.
You may also find here the makefile used for my linux pc and another one working on ISIMA's servers.
Instances can become very large, hence you will find some of them on this link instead:
